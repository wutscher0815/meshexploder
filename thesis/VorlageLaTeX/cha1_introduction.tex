\chapter{Introduction}
Exploded Views are awesome, if you want to show the inner works of a complex Object, for example the gears of an engine or the inner organs of an animal. To visualize, that the viewer is seeing something, that would normally be occlouded by another part of the object, this part is is drawn cut in multible pieces and moved away from the Object of interest in question. 
This thesis explores the possibilities, limitations problems and possible solutions should one want to generate Exploded views automatically and documents the authors effort to create a plug-in for the visualization Framework Volumeshop that in combination with ghosting generates such an exploded view.
