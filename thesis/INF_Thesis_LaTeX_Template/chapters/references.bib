  abstract =   "Illustrations play a major role in the education process.
               Whether used to teach a surgical or radiologic procedure, to
               illustrate normal or aberrant anatomy, or to explain the
               functioning of a technical device, illustration
               significantly impacts learning. Although many specimens are
               readily available as volumetric data sets, particularly in
               medicine, illustrations are commonly produced manually as
               static images in a time-consuming process. Our goal is to
               create a fully dynamic three-dimensional illustration
               environment which directly operates on volume data. Single
               images have the aesthetic appeal of traditional
               illustrations, but can be interactively altered and
               explored. In this paper we present methods to realize such a
               system which combines artistic visual styles and expressive
               visualization techniques. We introduce a novel concept for
               direct multi-object volume visualization which allows
               control of the appearance of inter-penetrating objects via
               two-dimensional transfer functions. Furthermore, a unifying
               approach to efficiently integrate many non-photorealistic
               rendering models is presented. We discuss several
               illustrative concepts which can be realized by combining
               cutaways, ghosting, and selective deformation. Finally, we
               also propose a simple interface to specify objects of
               interest through three-dimensional volumetric painting. All
               presented methods are integrated into VolumeShop, an
               interactive hardware-accelerated application for direct
               volume illustration.",

@ARTICLE{proc:bruckner-2006-EVV,
  title =      {Exploded Views for Volume Data},
  author =     {Stefan Bruckner and Meister Eduard Gr{\"o}ller},
  year =       {2006},
  abstract =   {Exploded views are an illustration technique where an object
               is partitioned into several segments. These segments are
               displaced to reveal otherwise hidden detail. In this paper
               we apply the concept of exploded views to volumetric data in
               order to solve the general problem of occlusion. In many
               cases an object of interest is occluded by other structures.
               While transparency or cutaways can be used to reveal a focus
               object, these techniques remove parts of the context
               information. Exploded views, on the other hand, do not
               suffer from this drawback. Our approach employs a
               force-based model: the volume is divided into a part
               configuration controlled by a number of forces and
               constraints. The focus object exerts an explosion force
               causing the parts to arrange according to the given
               constraints. We show that this novel and flexible approach
               allows for a wide variety of explosion-based visualizations
               including view-dependent explosions. Furthermore, we present
               a high-quality GPU-based volume ray casting algorithm for
               exploded views which allows rendering and interaction at
               several frames per second.},

               concealed by solid geometry and retaining its context at the
               same time. In this thesis, several approaches are presented
               that deal with this problem by finding user-centered
               solutions that are adjusted for each individual requirement.
               Moreover, a simple algorithm is proposed that combines
               existing approaches to reveal occluded structures.
               Therefore, a descriptive implementation of this algorithm is
               shown with VolumeShop, an application that flexibly supports
               visualization research.",
