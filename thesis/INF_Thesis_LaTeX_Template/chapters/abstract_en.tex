\chapter*{Abstract}

Explosive views are a technique in illustrative visualization where the inner working of complex objects is revealed by segmenting it into several parts that are then displaced so that ideally they are fully visible and their positions convey information about their original place in the object. This thesis deals with implementing a plug-in for the visualization software Volume Shop that is able to create simple dynamic exploding views from composite triangle meshes. To avoid behavior that renders the graphic useless when viewed from certain viewpoints, I combined exploded views with ghosting, which is a different illustrative technique where an object between the viewer and a more important object is drawn translucently.
