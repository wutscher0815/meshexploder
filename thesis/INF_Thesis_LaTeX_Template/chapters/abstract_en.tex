\chapter*{Abstract}

Exploded views are a technique in illustrative visualization where the inner working of complex objects is revealed by segmenting it into several parts that are then displaced so that ideally they are fully visible and their positions convey information about their original place in the object. This thesis deals with implementing a plug-in for the visualization software VolumeShop that is able to create simple dynamic exploding views from composite triangle meshes. Because the Illustration is interactive and can be viewed from all angles, the explosion distance becomes very large to infinite when looking at the object from a viewpoint close to the explosion axis.  To avoid this exploded views were combined with ghosting, which is a different illustrative technique where an object between the viewer and a more important object is drawn translucently.
